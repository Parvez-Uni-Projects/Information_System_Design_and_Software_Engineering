## Confidence Interval

- What is confidence interval?
    - In statistic , parameters of the population are often estimated on sample data. The confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the population parameter with a certain degree of confidence.
## For Example 
You want to know the heigh of all professional basketball players in USA
- You draw a sample
- The mean of the sample is most likely different from that of the population
- Each sample is likely to come up with a different mean

Now it is very useful to know a range in which the true value will life with a high probability . This range is called **confidence interval**

## What is a high probability?
For the calculation of the confidence interval the probability with which a parameter should lie in the interval must of course be defined .

The confidence level of 95% or 99% is very often used as probability. Which means when given 95% confidence interval , one can be 95% sure that the true parameter value lies within this interval.

## Where do you get the Z value

The z-value for the respective confidence interval can be read from a table in which the z-values for the respective confidence intervals are listed.

For example for the confidence interval of 95% the z-value is 1.96
